# GoGoFood
Group Project for a Software Engineering class at CSULA(2020).
Implemnting MVC architecture.

Approach for tackling as a group:For each of these sections indicate the person responsible for the section and
the people, if any, who provided assistance. For each method, a different
person should be responsible for each section. (Listing names will help us to know who to go to if we come across any questions)

*Design/strategy. Discuss the strategy the method uses to implement its
function. 
* Code. 
* Review. This section discusses the coding style issues the method
presented and why one approach was selected over another. For example,
does the code use a list comprehension or a for-loop. Why was the
particular choice made? 
* Testing. This section discusses the test cases that should be run to check
code functionality.
